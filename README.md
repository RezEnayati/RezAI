# RezAI
RezAi is a personalized language model fine-tuned on Reza Enayati's iMessage and WhatsApp conversations. The model is designed to replicate Rezaâ€™s natural texting style using a warm but neutral tone. It is trained using the Unsloth framework on Meta LLaMA 3.1 (8B) with LoRA adapters and 4-bit quantization for efficient and low-memory fine-tuning.
